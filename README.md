# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## Usage: 

You can use [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org) to find books you'd like to analyze.

Import your books into txt files in a `_books_` directory inside the `_root_` of the project folder.

### Run:

```
python3 main.py <path_to_book>
```
